Here are some noteworthy findings (abnormalities) along with corresponding CPT reports that could provide useful information to you.

Amniotic Fluid : Normal

 

Fetal Breathing Move : 0

Key Analysis:
â€¢ Fetal Breathing Movement (FBM) 0 refers to the absence of any visible breathing movements of the fetus during the ultrasound examination.

Recommendation:
â€¢ FBM 0 can be an indication of fetal compromise and further evaluation is recommended.
â€¢ A detailed fetal anatomic scan (CPTÂ® 76811) should be performed to assess for any structural abnormalities.
â€¢ Starting at 26 weeks, a Biophysical Profile (BPP) (CPTÂ® 76818 or CPTÂ® 76819) or a modified BPP (CPTÂ® 76815) can be performed once or twice weekly to assess fetal well-being.
â€¢ If FBM 0 is persistent or there are other concerning findings, additional testing such as Doppler ultrasound or fetal echocardiography may be considered.
â€¢ Close monitoring of fetal movements and regular follow-up ultrasounds are recommended to assess for any changes in fetal well-being.

confirmed diagnosis of polyhydramnios : maximum vertical pocket(MVP) â‰¥8cm.

Key Analysis:
â€¢ Polyhydramnios is confirmed when the maximum vertical pocket (MVP) is â‰¥8cm.
â€¢ Polyhydramnios can be an early presenting finding of fetal hydrops associated with fetal anemia, cardiac dysfunction, fetal arrhythmias, or cardiac malformation.

Recommendation:
â€¢ CPTÂ® 76811 (Detailed Fetal Anatomy) at diagnosis, if not previously performed.
â€¢ CPTÂ® 76816 starting at â‰¥23 weeks:
   - Every 3-4 weeks for mild polyhydramnios (AFI 24-29.9 cm or MVP 8-9.9 cm).
   - Every 2 weeks for severe polyhydramnios (AFI â‰¥30 cm or MVP â‰¥10 cm).
â€¢ CPTÂ® 76815 weekly for antepartum fetal surveillance starting at â‰¥23 weeks.
â€¢ BPP (CPTÂ® 76818 or CPTÂ® 76819) or modified BPP (CPTÂ® 76815) for AFI with NST starting at 26 weeks:
   - Weekly for mild polyhydramnios.
   - Twice weekly for severe polyhydramnios.
â€¢ CPTÂ® 76820 weekly starting at the time of diagnosis if â‰¥23 weeks.

Decreased Biophysical Profile : 

Key Analysis: 
â€¢ Decreased Biophysical Profile (BPP) refers to a BPP score of less than 8 out of 10.
â€¢ BPP is designed to predict the presence or absence of fetal asphyxia and the risk of fetal death.
â€¢ BPP evaluates parameters such as fetal breathing movements, gross fetal body movements, fetal tone, amniotic fluid volume, and reactive fetal heart rate.

Recommendation:
â€¢ If BPP score is â‰¤6, repeat BPP within 24 hours.
â€¢ If BPP score remains low, further evaluation and management should be determined based on clinical judgment and individual circumstances.
â€¢ Consider additional testing such as umbilical artery Doppler (CPTÂ® 76820) or consultation with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist.
â€¢ Close monitoring of fetal well-being and consideration of delivery may be necessary in cases of persistent low BPP scores.

Here are some noteworthy findings (abnormalities) along with corresponding CPT reports that could provide useful information to you.

Amniotic Fluid : Normal

 

Fetal Movements : 0

Key Analysis:
â€¢ Fetal Movements 0 refers to the complaint of decreased fetal movement.

Recommendation:
â€¢ One of the following can be performed at the time of the complaint of decreased fetal movement: Limited ultrasound or modified BPP (CPTÂ® 76815).
â€¢ If â‰¥26 weeks, BPP (CPTÂ® 76818 or CPTÂ® 76819) or a modified BPP (CPTÂ® 76815) can be performed.
â€¢ CPTÂ® 76816 can be performed for delivery planning if BPP/Modified BPP is abnormal.
â€¢ Subsequent/repeat ultrasound is not usually necessary unless there are new indications or if BPP is abnormal.

confirmed diagnosis of polyhydramnios : maximum vertical pocket(MVP) â‰¥8cm.

Key Analysis:
â€¢ Polyhydramnios is confirmed when the maximum vertical pocket (MVP) is â‰¥8cm.
â€¢ Polyhydramnios can be an early presenting finding of fetal hydrops associated with fetal anemia, cardiac dysfunction, fetal arrhythmias, or cardiac malformation.

Recommendation:
â€¢ CPTÂ® 76811 (Detailed Fetal Anatomy) at diagnosis, if not previously performed
â€¢ CPTÂ® 76816 starting at â‰¥23 weeks:
   - Every 3-4 weeks for mild polyhydramnios (AFI 24-29.9 cm or MVP 8-9.9 cm)
   - Every 2 weeks for severe polyhydramnios (AFI â‰¥30 cm or MVP â‰¥10 cm)
â€¢ CPTÂ® 76815 weekly for antepartum fetal surveillance starting at â‰¥23 weeks
â€¢ BPP (CPTÂ® 76818 or CPTÂ® 76819) or modified BPP (CPTÂ® 76815) for AFI with NST starting at 26 weeks:
   - Weekly for mild polyhydramnios
   - Twice weekly for severe polyhydramnios
â€¢ CPTÂ® 76820 weekly starting at the time of diagnosis if â‰¥23 weeks.

Decreased fetal tone : 

Key Analysis:
â€¢ Decreased fetal tone refers to reduced or absent movement of the fetus.
â€¢ It is an abnormal finding and may indicate fetal distress or neurological abnormalities.

Recommendation:
â€¢ Further evaluation is necessary, including a detailed fetal anatomic scan (CPTÂ® 76811) to assess for any structural abnormalities.
â€¢ Non-stress test (NST) or biophysical profile (BPP) can be performed to assess fetal well-being.
â€¢ Consultation with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist or a pediatric neurologist may be considered for further evaluation and management.
