Here are some noteworthy findings (abnormalities) along with corresponding CPT reports that could provide useful information to you.

Fetal Position : Breech

Key Analysis: 
â€¢ Suspected abnormal fetal position or presentation (breech presentation) at â‰¥36 weeks gestation.

Recommendation:
â€¢ To confirm suspected abnormal fetal position or presentation (breech presentation) at â‰¥36 weeks gestation, report one of the following:
   - CPTÂ® 76805 (plus CPTÂ® 76810 for each additional fetus) when a complete anatomy scan has not yet been performed in the pregnancy
   - CPTÂ® 76815 for a limited ultrasound to check fetal position
   - CPTÂ® 76816 if version is being considered and/or for delivery planning.
â€¢ Fetal presentation should be assessed by abdominal palpation (Leopolds) at 36 weeks or later, when presentation is likely to influence the plans for the birth.
â€¢ Routine assessment of presentation by abdominal palpation before 36 weeks is not always accurate.
â€¢ Suspected fetal malpresentation should be confirmed by an ultrasound assessment.
â€¢ An ultrasound can be performed at â‰¥36 weeks gestation to determine fetal position to allow for external cephalic version.
â€¢ Ultrasound to determine fetal position is not necessary prior to 36 weeks gestation unless delivery is imminent.
â€¢ CPTÂ® 76815 should never be reported with complete studies CPTÂ® 76801/CPTÂ® 76802, CPTÂ® 76805/CPTÂ® 76810, or CPTÂ® 76811/CPTÂ® 76812 or with CPTÂ® 76816 or BPP (CPTÂ® 76818 and CPTÂ® 76819).

Placenta Previa : Yes

Key Analysis:
- Placenta Previa is a condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the cervix.
- Placenta Previa is classified into three types: complete, partial, and marginal.

Recommendation:
- For known placenta previa or low lying placenta (placental edge <2 cm from internal os), one routine follow-up ultrasound can be performed in the 3rd trimester (CPTÂ® 76815 or CPTÂ® 76816 and/or CPTÂ® 76817).
- If placenta previa or low lying placenta is still present, one follow-up ultrasound can be performed in 3-4 weeks.
- If persistent placenta previa (placental edge covers the internal cervical os), BPP (CPTÂ® 76818/CPTÂ® 76819) or modified BPP (CPTÂ® 76815) should be performed weekly, starting at 32 weeks.
- Follow-up ultrasound can be performed at any time if bleeding occurs.
- There is no clear benefit from more frequent ultrasounds in stable cases.
- The optimal route and timing of delivery should be determined based on follow-up ultrasounds at approximately 32 weeks and 36 weeks of gestation (if the previa persists).

Suboptimal views of nasal bone and cisterna magna : 

Key Analysis:
â€¢ Suboptimal views of the nasal bone and cisterna magna refer to inadequate visualization of these structures during an ultrasound examination.
â€¢ Suboptimal views of the nasal bone and cisterna magna can be a result of fetal position, maternal body habitus, or technical limitations of the ultrasound equipment.

Recommendation:
â€¢ If suboptimal views of the nasal bone and cisterna magna are noted, a follow-up ultrasound (CPTÂ® 76815 or CPTÂ® 76816) is indicated for further evaluation.
â€¢ The follow-up ultrasound should be performed to ensure adequate visualization of the nasal bone and cisterna magna.
â€¢ If the follow-up ultrasound still fails to provide adequate visualization, additional imaging modalities, such as MRI, may be considered for further evaluation.
â€¢ It is important to note that suboptimal views of the nasal bone and cisterna magna alone are not considered significant findings and do not typically warrant further testing or intervention.

Recommendation:
- One routine follow-up ultrasound can be performed in the 3rd trimester (CPTÂ® 76815 or CPTÂ® 76816 and/or CPTÂ® 76817).
- If placenta previa is still present, one follow-up ultrasound can be performed in 3-4 weeks.
- If persistent placenta previa is present (placental edge covers the internal cervical os), a Biophysical Profile (BPP) or modified BPP can be performed weekly, starting at 32 weeks.
- Follow-up ultrasound can be performed at any time if bleeding occurs.
- There is no clear benefit from more frequent ultrasounds (eg, every 4 weeks) in stable cases.

Suboptimal views of nasal bone and cisterna magna : 

Key Analysis:
â€¢ Suboptimal views of the nasal bone and cisterna magna refer to inadequate visualization of these structures during a fetal ultrasound.
â€¢ These findings are considered suboptimal and may indicate a need for further evaluation.

Recommendation:
â€¢ If suboptimal views of the nasal bone and cisterna magna are identified, a follow-up ultrasound (CPTÂ® 76815 or CPTÂ® 76816) is recommended for better visualization of these structures.
â€¢ The follow-up ultrasound should be performed to determine if there are any abnormalities or concerns related to the nasal bone and cisterna magna.
â€¢ It is important to note that suboptimal views alone are not considered a significant finding and do not typically warrant further testing or intervention.

Here are some noteworthy findings (abnormalities) along with corresponding CPT reports that could provide useful information to you.

Fetal Position : Breech

Key Analysis:
â€¢ Suspected abnormal fetal position: Breech presentation.
â€¢ To confirm suspected abnormal fetal position or presentation (transverse or breech presentation) at â‰¥36 weeks gestation, report one of the following:
   - CPTÂ® 76805 (plus CPTÂ® 76810 for each additional fetus) when a complete anatomy scan has not yet been performed in the pregnancy or
   - CPTÂ® 76815 for a limited ultrasound to check fetal position or

Recommendation:
â€¢ To confirm suspected abnormal fetal position or presentation (breech), a limited ultrasound (CPTÂ® 76815) can be performed.
â€¢ If version is being considered and/or for delivery planning, CPTÂ® 76816 can be reported.
â€¢ Fetal presentation should be assessed by abdominal palpation (Leopolds) at 36 weeks or later.
â€¢ Ultrasound to determine fetal position is not necessary prior to 36 weeks gestation unless delivery is imminent.

Placenta Previa : Yes

Key Analysis:
- Placenta Previa is a condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the cervix.
- Placenta Previa is classified as low-lying placenta or complete placenta previa.
- Placenta Previa is a high-risk condition that can cause bleeding during pregnancy and delivery complications.

Recommendation:
- One routine follow-up ultrasound can be performed in the 3rd trimester (CPTÂ® 76815 or CPTÂ® 76816 and/or CPTÂ® 76817).
- If placenta previa or low-lying placenta is still present, one follow-up ultrasound can be performed in 3-4 weeks.
- If persistent placenta previa (placental edge covers the internal cervical os), BPP (CPTÂ® 76818/CPTÂ® 76819 or modified BPP (CPTÂ® 76815) can be performed weekly, starting at 32 weeks.
- Follow-up ultrasound can be performed at any time if bleeding occurs.
- Cervical length screening every 2 to 4 weeks starting at 28 weeks (CPTÂ® 76817 and CPTÂ® 76816 or CPTÂ® 76815) if vasa previa is confirmed.
- There is no clear benefit from more frequent ultrasounds in stable cases.

Suboptimal views of nasal bone and cisterna magna : 

Key Analysis:
â€¢ Suboptimal views of nasal bone and cisterna magna refer to inadequate visualization of these structures during an ultrasound examination.
â€¢ These suboptimal views may occur due to fetal position, maternal body habitus, or technical limitations of the ultrasound equipment.

Recommendation:
â€¢ If suboptimal views of nasal bone and cisterna magna are encountered during the initial ultrasound examination, a follow-up ultrasound (CPTÂ® 76815 or CPTÂ® 76816) can be performed to obtain better visualization.
â€¢ It is important to ensure that the follow-up ultrasound is performed by an experienced sonographer or physician to maximize the chances of obtaining optimal views.
â€¢ If the follow-up ultrasound still fails to provide adequate visualization, referral to a specialized center or a fetal medicine specialist may be considered for further evaluation.
â€¢ It is important to note that suboptimal views of nasal bone and cisterna magna alone are not considered significant findings and do not typically warrant further testing or intervention.
â€¢ The overall interpretation of the ultrasound findings should take into account other markers and risk factors for fetal abnormalities.
