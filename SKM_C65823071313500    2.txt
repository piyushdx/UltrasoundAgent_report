         Single female fetus seen with positive fetal movement.
        FHR=150bpm with normal cardiac rhythm.
       EFW=100z
         Amniotic fluid appears wnl.
         Anatomy well visualized with the exception of limited facial and cardiac views due to
         persistent fetal lie, no obvious abnormalities seen.
         Posterior placenta grade 2, complete previa seen.
        The cervix was seen transabdominally measuring 7.3cm
