First trimester screening in twins has a similar detection rate to singleton gestation.\n• Birth weight discordance = (larger twin weight minus smaller twin weight) divided by larger twin weight × 100.\n• Universal CL screening with transvaginal ultrasound (CPT® 76817) is NOT recommended in twin gestations. In addition, per ACOG, cerclage placement (prophylactic or rescue) should be avoided in multifetal pregnancies. However, because several studies have shown that a one-time CL measurement ≤20 mm at 18-24 weeks may be an accurate predictor of preterm birth in multiple gestation, and because progesterone therapy might reduce the risk of neonatal morbidity and mortality associated with PTB, then a one-time transvaginal CL assessment can be performed if transabdominal CL measures ≤3.6 cm (as with singleton gestation - see Cervical Length Screening (OB-7.3)).\n• TTTS is diagnosed by the ultrasound findings of polyhydramnios in one twin (the recipient) and oligohydramnios in the other twin (the donor). If AFI is discordant between the twins (low but not <2 cm in one and/or high but not >8 cm in the other); weekly imaging (MCA and/or limited US) can be performed to rule out developing TTTS.\n• There is no evidence that routine assessment with UA Doppler is beneficial in the absence of growth or fluid discordance. Fetal loss of one twin during the first trimester does not appear to increase the risk of FGR or preterm delivery in the surviving twin; however, loss of one or more fetus(es) after 17 weeks gestation is associated with increased risk for FGR and PTB and should be imaged according to Multiple Gestations (OB-11). Monochorionic twin pregnancies with the demise of one twin after 17 weeks have up to an 18% chance of major morbidity or mortality for the remaining fetus.\n• Typically all components of the BPP (CPT® 76818 and CPT® 76819), such as breathing, are not present until ≥26 weeks gestation. However, a modified BPP (CPT® 76815) can be performed sooner in certain high-risk cases but should not be done prior to viability (23 weeks).

These complications relate to preterm labor, placental abruption, fetal growth restriction, and fetal compression syndromes. The risk of preterm labor appears to correlate with the size of the fibroid (over 600 cm3) and/or the presence of multiple fibroids. Placental abruption has been reported to occur frequently in pregnancies complicated by fibroids, especially with placentation over a fibroid. Fibroid volumes >200 cm3 are more commonly associated with fetal growth restriction. Fetal compression syndrome is a direct result of large fibroids and is not commonly found with small fibroids.

If these techniques are necessary in addition to ultrasound or MRI or are more readily available for the diagnosis in question, they should not be withheld from a pregnant patient. o The use of gadolinium contrast with MRI should be limited; it should be used as a contrast agent in a pregnant woman only if it significantly improves diagnostic performance and is expected to improve fetal or maternal outcome. o With regards to iodinated IV contrast media, “it is generally recommended that contrast only be used if absolutely required to obtain additional diagnostic information that will affect the care of the fetus or woman during pregnancy”.",
