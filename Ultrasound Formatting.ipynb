      "The comprehensive guidelines for fetal position breech along with CPT reports are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. To confirm suspected abnormal fetal position or presentation (transverse or breech presentation) at ≥36 weeks gestation, report one of the following:\n",
      "- CPT® 76805 (plus CPT® 76810 for each additional fetus) when complete anatomy scan has not yet been performed in the pregnancy\n",
      "- CPT® 76815 for limited ultrasound to check fetal position\n",
      "- CPT® 76816 if version is being considered and/or for delivery planning\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Fetal presentation should be assessed by abdominal palpation (Leopold's) at 36 weeks or later, when presentation is likely to influence the plans for the birth. Routine assessment of presentation by abdominal palpation before 36 weeks is not always accurate. Suspected fetal malpresentation should be confirmed by an ultrasound assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. An ultrasound can be performed at ≥36 weeks gestation to determine fetal position to allow for external cephalic version. Ultrasound to determine fetal position is not necessary prior to 36 weeks gestation unless delivery is imminent.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. CPT® 76815 should never be reported with complete studies CPT® 76801/CPT® 76802, CPT® 76805/CPT® 76810, or CPT® 76811/CPT® 76812 or with CPT® 76816 or BPP (CPT® 76818 and CPT® 76819).\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that these guidelines are based on the Obstetrical (OB) Ultrasound (US) Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 provided by eviCore healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Placenta Previa : Yes\n",
      "\n",
      "For known placenta previa (placental edge covers the internal cervical os) or low-lying placenta (placental edge <2 cm from internal os), the following guidelines apply:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. One routine follow-up ultrasound can be performed in the 3rd trimester (CPT® 76815 or CPT® 76816 and/or CPT® 76817)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. If placenta previa or low-lying placenta is still present, one follow-up ultrasound (CPT® 76815 or CPT® 76816 and/or CPT® 76817) can be performed in 3-4 weeks\n",
      "\n",
      "3. If persistent placenta previa (placental edge covers the internal cervical os), BPP (CPT® 76818/CPT® 76819 or modified BPP (CPT® 76815) can be performed weekly, starting at 32 weeks\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Follow-up ultrasound can be performed at any time if bleeding occurs, using BPP (CPT® 76818 or CPT® 76819) or CPT® 76815 or CPT® 76816 if a complete ultrasound was done previously and/or CPT® 76817\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that these guidelines are based on the Obstetrical (OB) Ultrasound (US) Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023. It is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional for comprehensive and up-to-date guidelines specific to your situation.\n"
